i go nonverbal a lot, often mid scene if it gets intense and that can carry over into aftercare - one that that works for me incredibly well is when a couple of people have read over vc, or talked at me. it’s really useful to me to have someone there and present but not necessarily forcing a response from me &amp; helps me get my brain back to closer to where it needs to be to be able to talk or go through things. listening to or investing in my hyperfixations also helps a lot - listening to certain soundtracks or songs on repeat helps bring me back to a state where i can break through some of the dissociation.

<br> i drop really quite bad. a lot of play that i do incorporates stuff that i have ptsd in relation too, and not getting proper aftercare can really fuck with things (though even with proper aftercare drops can still hit bad). i need to talk through intense scenes. i need to know that the dom enjoyed themselves, to get confirmation that they were invested in the scene and that they enjoyed it. the space to ask questions, to go over things that i like/didn’t like. to ask what they did! sometimes doms don’t want to go over it in too much detail / are too shut off to be able to accept aftercare and that’s super fine but it’s important to me to be able to at least check on how they are feeling because otherwise i’ll be nervous about it and then probably drop lmfao. i really struggle when play partners aren’t open about how they feel - even if they didn’t like something it’s so much better when things are open &amp; upfront. makes me feel safer to know they will tell me when something doesn’t align, or if something made them uncomfortable.<br>i have a lot of guilt associated with what i call the ‘consequences’ of playing with me, because i know that aftercare with me can take quite a long time if i am dropping or if ptsd sets in (if we were fucking around with trauma related stuff). i only do it with people i trust regardless, but i still find it quite difficult to accept that people understand that aftercare is a part of engaging in those kinks - my brain is geared to the idea that my play partners are not interested in what is happening &amp; want to be done with it immediately - and my brain likes to cling to the ideas it’s decided to attach to - so being shown otherwise is always helpful. i do not usually really want lots of cuddles/kisses/lots of praise. genuine comments on what went well in the scene, on things they enjoyed or liked - very helpful. heavy praise makes me feel too much like i am filling a role once again, which is the opposite of what i want. affirmations are just great. i’ve talked abt them a lot but reaffirming that they don’t view me as fragile if i have a ptsd moment or drop - that they want to play again and it hasn’t changed their view of me / it doesn’t make them think of me as weak is helpful. affirming that i enjoyed it, that i had fun and they have not hurt me or done anything i didn’t want etc. affirming that those aren’t their actual views - after mikey did some intenseish appearance degradation in on theme the aftercare was just very silly talks about what he was actually thinking during the scene &amp; how misaligned it was with the things he was saying. very helpfu]]></description><link>aftercare\nonverbal.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Aftercare/NONVERBAL.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 23:17:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[NORMAL]]></title><description><![CDATA[
