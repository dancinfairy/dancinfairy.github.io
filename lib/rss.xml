 <br>what can this look like?<br>
<br>mood drops can be accompanied by a lack of clear emotion in speech and text will often be found with heart emotes like this - usually ones that lack colour or excitement <img alt="stoopid-emotes.png" src="aftercare\stoopid-emotes.png">

<br>not always something i will notice happening, but is a good indicator when trying to gage the situation

<br>sometimes i won't be dropping (shockhorrorwhoknew)
<br>usually as a result of comfy aftercare &amp; a good transition, or if the play was not very intense or it wasn't one of the <a data-href="times i might need it!" href="aftercare\times-i-might-need-it!.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">times i might need it!</a>
<br>hanging out together after is super useful if everything is going okay! if we both have time, spending it together casually &amp; talking about the play &amp; completely unrelated things helps to settle back into reality and act as a grounding method &lt;3
<br>
<br>yap abt funny stuff idk. rare! comfy fun. hangout etc. will write more idk. ]]></description><link>aftercare\chill.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Aftercare/chill.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 23:14:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[helpful]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>
a reminder to clean myself up, take my toys out! 

<br>if i'm intensely subby, i won't want to assume/do things without asking - &amp; brain fog can make me forget these are the next steps to take at all!


<br>
be direct &amp; open

<br>i can get in my head if things feel fake or put on - just be yourself &amp; try to be as direct/upfront as you can - &amp; i'll try to do the same.


<br>
debriefing!<br>
i want to know ALL of your thoughts. what did you like? what didn't you like? specificity is good here. <a data-href="please god no" href="aftercare\please-god-no.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">please god no</a> veer away from flattering/intense praise! 

<br>if we are both feeling good this can be in the moment - if i'm <a data-href="nonverbal" href="aftercare\nonverbal.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">nonverbal</a> or <a data-href="dropping" href="aftercare\dropping.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">dropping</a> this can be difficult - in those cases talking about it later and/or the next day is great
<br>point to specific elements in play!
<br>ask questions, let me know if you want clarification, if things could be different for another time
<br>let me do the same
<br>when done well this brings security to playing with you &amp; helps me understand how to move forward. eliminates lots of anxieties!


<br>
gendering &lt;3

<br>if it was a scene involving misgendering - this includes anything related to continued use of solely she/her pronouns or referring to me as a girl - this is super helpful &amp; grounding. reminds me you don't see me like that &amp; that you recognise me as a person etc. if you make a mistake, that's totally fine. happens a lot! best thing to do is not to make it a big deal - it won't be unless it's turned into one!

i need to talk through intense scenes. i need to know that the dom enjoyed themselves, to get confirmation that they were invested in the scene and that they enjoyed it. the space to ask questions, to go over things that i like/didn’t like. to ask what they did! sometimes doms don’t want to go over it in too much detail / are too shut off to be able to accept aftercare and that’s super fine but it’s important to me to be able to at least check on how they are feeling because otherwise i’ll be nervous about it and then probably drop lmfao. i really struggle when play partners aren’t open about how they feel - even if they didn’t like something it’s so much better when things are open &amp; upfront. makes me feel safer to know they will tell me when something doesn’t align, or if something made them uncomfortable.

 <br>firstly - this doesn't necessarily mean that i am <a data-href="dropping" href="aftercare\dropping.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">dropping</a>, or that i will! it can happen just as a result of intense subbiness and the transition out of it. <br>
<br>if you've found your way here, i'm likely not making much sense. my apologies! please don't be afraid, i am not angry at you nor am i trying to ignore you.

<br>
pasted in from kink discuss - for own reference not for here:<br>
i go nonverbal a lot, often mid scene if it gets intense and that can carry over into aftercare - one that that works for me incredibly well is when a couple of people have read over vc, or talked at me. it’s really useful to me to have someone there and present but not necessarily forcing a response from me &amp; helps me get my brain back to closer to where it needs to be to be able to talk or go through things. listening to or investing in my hyperfixations also helps a lot - listening to certain soundtracks or songs on repeat helps bring me back to a state where i can break through some of the dissociation.

<br> i drop really quite bad. a lot of play that i do incorporates stuff that i have ptsd in relation too, and not getting proper aftercare can really fuck with things (though even with proper aftercare drops can still hit bad). i need to talk through intense scenes. i need to know that the dom enjoyed themselves, to get confirmation that they were invested in the scene and that they enjoyed it. the space to ask questions, to go over things that i like/didn’t like. to ask what they did! sometimes doms don’t want to go over it in too much detail / are too shut off to be able to accept aftercare and that’s super fine but it’s important to me to be able to at least check on how they are feeling because otherwise i’ll be nervous about it and then probably drop lmfao. i really struggle when play partners aren’t open about how they feel - even if they didn’t like something it’s so much better when things are open &amp; upfront. makes me feel safer to know they will tell me when something doesn’t align, or if something made them uncomfortable.<br>i have a lot of guilt associated with what i call the ‘consequences’ of playing with me, because i know that aftercare with me can take quite a long time if i am dropping or if ptsd sets in (if we were fucking around with trauma related stuff). i only do it with people i trust regardless, but i still find it quite difficult to accept that people understand that aftercare is a part of engaging in those kinks - <br>my brain is geared to the idea that my play partners are not interested in what is happening &amp; want to be done with it immediately - and my brain likes to cling to the ideas it’s decided to attach to - so being shown otherwise is always helpful. <br>i do not usually really want lots of cuddles/kisses/lots of praise.<br>
genuine comments on what went well in the scene, on things they enjoyed or liked - very helpful. heavy praise makes me feel too much like i am filling a role once again, which is the opposite of what i want.<br>
affirmations are just great. i’ve talked abt them a lot but reaffirming that they don’t view me as fragile if i have a ptsd moment or drop - that they want to play again and it hasn’t changed their view of me / it  doesn’t make them think of me as weak is helpful. affirming that i enjoyed it, that i had fun and they have not hurt me or done anything i didn’t want etc. affirming that those aren’t their actual views - after mikey did some intenseish appearance degradation in on theme the aftercare was just very silly talks about what he was actually thinking during the scene &amp; how misaligned it was with the things he was saying. very helpfu]]></description><link>aftercare\nonverbal.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Aftercare/nonverbal.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 23:12:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[please god no]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>
<br>referring to me in a childlike manner

<br>especially if i am dropping, try to avoid throwing in words like 'little', 'baby' or anything of the sort, even if you don't think those relate to that. in that headspace this can bring up <a data-href="PTSD" href="aftercare\ptsd.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PTSD</a> related things and make it worse xx


<br>orders related to food

<br>i know this is something lots of subs like, i understand how helpful this can be! but please for the love of god. tell me to get water or smth instead!! can interact with disordered eating behaviours. at most, a gentle reminder if i have snacks or food around - but please don't make it an obligation.


<br>intense praise!

<br>this can feel flattering, or fake. reassurances are super <a data-href="helpful" href="aftercare\helpful.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">helpful</a>, if they are accurate, but please don't say things for the sake of it or go overboard because you want me to feel better. vagueness, or fawning can increase the anxieties you may be trying to quell, or squash trust that you would tell me if something was wrong &lt;3
<br>heavy praise makes me feel too much like i am filling a role once again, which is the opposite of what i want. 


<br>telling me to shush/shut up/or jokes at my expense

<br>this can be context dependant, but in general, i take things very literally right after a scene - so it's something to be mindful of if that's not your intended reaction.


<br>demanding audible/understandable responses and/or giving lots of tasks i can't complete

<br>often my speech will be unintelligible following play &amp; i may not be able to move very much! demanding or placing expectations on those things will cause them to take longer to return &amp; can lead to feelings of disappointment &amp; failure &lt;3


<br>sexualising emotional responses 

<br>once we have moved into aftercare, there needs to be a clear separation between play &amp; us as people. if i'm crying or unable to speak, sexualising this can trigger <a data-href="PTSD" href="aftercare\ptsd.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PTSD</a> responses
<br>using the clicker on the vc soundboard is also v unhelpful - will make me more subby and that is the opposite of the goal here!
<br>well aware lots of subs are okay with horny aftercare but for whatever time we are remaining horny - i'm gna need some time after that to get back to normal.

<br>CSA (childhood sexual assault) is a major thing in my past

<br>can be triggered in ways that are unrelated to the scene
<br>unless explicitly told - triggering this is NOT your fault


<br>if this comes up - there are some general responses folks might have that can make it worse and/or are just not things that are great to hear &lt;3

<br>bringing in pity/sympathy
<br>calling me 'brave' for what happened
<br>pressing for details
<br>expressing wishes of violence to my family
<br>treating me as fragile or easily breakable


<br>asjfdksfn i dont know what to write here i dont know what is too much and what is too little and ksjbdjshfdjkbknsdfaldkjfsndf;gksvc fucksake<br>yap abt triggers maybe? idk if i want ppl to know specific ones. can be weaponised badly question mark <br>what it can look like woa <br>
<br>can take the form of flashbacks, hallucinations, hyperventilating etc. varies often - sometimes will just lead into a normal drop.
<br>often accompanied by high levels of guilt/shame/embarrassment - likely to receive a lot of apologies in this time - through text if my speech is unintelligible or not present (<a data-href="nonverbal" href="aftercare\nonverbal.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">nonverbal</a>)
<br>yap abt response / what it can look like. that ppl can leave, etc &amp; it'll be fine?<br>
hyperventilating vs unable to speak. guilt etc.

 <br>hi! this is an aftercare document for indi/fairy/sol! if you're reading this then hopefully this can help to explain what might happen on my end, what sort of things are helpful, and how things can play out. oftentimes i will get <a data-href="nonverbal" href="aftercare\nonverbal.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">nonverbal</a> in aftercare, or may just be unintelligible - so i hope this can help communicate in my absence of ability!<br>aftercare is a big deal - and i struggle to accept it or to feel like it is not a burden to engage it. i hope this can help you gage what it might be like, and come into things with an informed perspective on if you actually want to play with me and the extent you want to take things to &lt;3. <br>firstly it's probably good to have a look at <a data-href="times i might need it!" href="aftercare\times-i-might-need-it!.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">times i might need it!</a> generally, i do prefer these forms of play, but as they feel more intense that means the later steps will be the same.<br>while there are some things that are going to be <a data-href="helpful" href="aftercare\helpful.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">helpful</a>, or a <a data-href="please god no" href="aftercare\please-god-no.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">please god no</a> in most situations, it can also take different routes, from <a data-href="chill" href="aftercare\chill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">chill</a>, to <a data-href="dropping" href="aftercare\dropping.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">dropping</a>, to times that my <a data-href="PTSD" href="aftercare\ptsd.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PTSD</a> may rear it's head, &amp; if the <a data-href="nonverbal" href="aftercare\nonverbal.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">nonverbal</a> headspace comes into play. ]]></description><link>aftercare\readme.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Aftercare/README.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 23:17:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[times i might need it!]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>aftercare can look different depending on what we engaged with in the play! an understanding of this will build the more we play, but this is for a rough guide. <br>examples of times it's definitely useful:<br>
<br>voiceplay - especially if consistently on vc for extended periods
<br>cucking &amp;/or plays that involve other subs
<br>scenes that might pull from my <a data-href="PTSD" href="aftercare\ptsd.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PTSD</a>, or trauma related play
<br>intense painplay
<br>overstim play and/or multiple goes of cumming &lt;3
<br>appearance degradation 
<br>TBA
<br>if the play is mostly roleplay based, text based etc, it's less likely for me to experience a drop or need extensive aftercare. that's not to say there won't be exceptions, but it pulls on my emotions in a different way &lt;3]]></description><link>aftercare\times-i-might-need-it!.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Aftercare/times i might need it!.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 19:33:30 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
